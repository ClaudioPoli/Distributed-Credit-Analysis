# Distributed Credit Analysis
University project in "Big Data Management and Analysis" in which machine learning techniques have been explored in a distributed environment.

In this project, Apache Spark is used to simulate a cluster on which to perform a CRISP-DM analysis in a distributed environment.

The implementation involved the following phases:

- Import of the dataset
- Exploratory analysis
- Cleaning and refinement
- Modeling and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning of the most promising model
